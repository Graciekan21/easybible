Throughout the entire development process, testing was ongoing. I used Chrome Developer Tools to identify and troubleshoot any issues as they arose. During development, I relied on Google Developer Tools to verify functionality and assist with problem-solving when things didn't work as expected.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)The HTML on the all page of the website was validated using W3C. Additionally, the CSS was also validated using the same tool.

- [index.html](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fgraciekan21.github.io%2Feasybible%2F) - Passed with no error.

- [style.css](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) - passed with no error.

---

### JavaScript Validator

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript.

- [javascript.js]() - Passed.

---

### Lighthouse

I utilized Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO of the website.
