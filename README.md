Test your bible knowledge!

As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about a particular Bible quiz web page's history. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the concept and the development of online Bible quizzes.

Online Bible quizzes have gained popularity as a way for individuals to test their knowledge of the Bible, learn more about its contents, and engage in a community of like-minded individuals. These quizzes often cover a wide range of topics, including biblical stories, characters, theology, and more.

[YouGov](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/explore/topic/The_Bible-Topic) show that 48% of people are round the world surveyed have heard of a Bible quiz, and are rated as the very influential.

Am inspired by various motivations,
Educational Purpose:

Promoting Bible Knowledge: A primary motivation is to encourage and facilitate the learning of the Bible. Quizzes can cover a range of topics from specific verses to general themes, helping individuals deepen their understanding of the scriptures.
Youth and Sunday School: Bible quizzes are often used as educational tools in youth groups, Sunday school classes, and other educational settings to make learning about the Bible more engaging for younger audiences.
Spiritual Growth:

Personal and Spiritual Development: Creating or participating in Bible quizzes can be a means for individuals to strengthen their faith, reflect on biblical teachings, and engage in personal spiritual growth.
Community Building:

Church Groups and Communities: Bible quizzes can serve as a fun and interactive way to bring members of a church community together. They provide a shared activity that promotes fellowship and discussion around biblical topics.
Online Ministry:

Reaching a Global Audience: With the rise of online platforms, individuals and organizations may create Bible quizzes as a way to reach a global audience, allowing people from different parts of the world to engage in discussions about the Bible, Many more.

### Colour Scheme

 Am using  website

In my css file I have used variables to declare colours because it easy to make change color any time you want.

- I am using `rgb(255, 255, 255)`,`rgb(156, 158, 167)`,`#cbd2dc` & `white` colors for the background-linear-gradient image and text.
- I am using `black`,`rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.825)` for the border and questions display.
- I am using `rgb(1, 3, 3)` for the answer display.
- 1 am using `#fcf5f5` for answers when hovered over and for the `rgba(7, 10, 7, 0.3)` for answer display
- i am using `red` when answer is wrong and green when answer is correct.

 Google Fonts am using to import the fonts for using in the site.

- For the Page Title I am using the google font [Roboto](@import url('<https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital>,wght@0,500;1,400&display=swap');
Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open curves.

[Robert fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=Robot)
 For all the text of the web-page I am using the google fonts by Robert.

### Features

This webpage is composed of a one page website which is the quiz page, it has points scored button, a pop up when the question are answered to show the scores, a play again button to erase the answers for restart; a 404 error page.

#### The Home Page

The Easy bible quiz displays the questions on the home page and by using a cursor a user can scroll up and down the home page. The title is also displayed on top of the page and then a containers which the text questions and answers are displayed, including the play again button that when clicked it takes the user back to the home page at any time.

The user can only one attempt to select an answer per question untill done with all the questions displayed.

When the answer a user chooses one of the answers, if the answer chosen is wrong; correct-answer will show green automatically.

![Alert](/documentation/features/marks.png)

Am using a The pop up that alerts after completing the quiz and shows the user marks of what they have  got out of the number of questions.

#### The Future for the site

In future I would like to:

1. I want to add interactive and engaging elements to your Bible quiz web page can enhance the user experience.
2. Timer: Add a timer for each question to create a sense of urgency. Users can feel challenged to answer quickly, making the quiz more exciting.
3. Multimedia: Incorporate multimedia elements such as images or short audio clips related to the questions. This can make the quiz more visually appealing and engaging.
4. Randomized Questions: Shuffle the order of questions each time the quiz is taken to prevent users from memorizing the sequence.

### Accessibility

- Using  HTML.
- Using hover satetment.
- Using sans-serif bold text to ensure that they are readable even for younger users

In future i want to put into effect a tick for the correct answer anda cross for a wrong answer

I wanted to add a back ground image on the webpage but it wasn't displaying the way i wanted it to.                                                                             I solved by removing it completly and replacing it with background-image: linear-gradient(rgb(255, 255, 255),
     rgb(156, 158, 167), as the background image. it worked.
            #cbd2dc).

         2.                                                                                                              The correct marks are not showing on the pop up alert after the user finishes answering all the question. I had to correct my javascript by (always divide by 4 for every repeated increment) and using (total_attempts / 4 >= total_questions) then it displays the correct marks at the end of the quiz|

Solved it by watch youtube channels on howways of putting google fonts in css  and i got a solution on.
